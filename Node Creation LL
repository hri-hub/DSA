//Create a single node dynamically using a class Node
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;

    Node(int data) {
        val = data;
        next = NULL;
    }
};

int main() {
    Node* n = new Node(1);  
    cout << n->val << " " << n->next << endl;
    return 0;
}

/*Constructor --> 9th line 
 Constructor  //Dynamic declaration
  Node(int data) {
      value = data;
      next = NULL;
  }
  Node* n1 = new Node(10); //This calls Node() above n gets executed
  Node* n2 = new Node(20); 

Without Constructor //Declare Manually for each Node 
  Node* n1 = new Node;
  n1->value = 10;
  n1->next = NULL;

Node* n2 = new Node;
n2->value = 20;
n2->next = NULL;

Why No use of head??
     Your code doesn't need a head pointer because it creates only one node.
 However, in a real linked list, head is essential for keeping track of the first node to traverse or modify the list.

Why Use -> Instead of . in C++??
     The arrow operator (->) is used in C++ to access members of a class or struct through a pointer.
->(arrow)....	When accessing members through a pointer....	pointer->val
n->val equals (*n).val
